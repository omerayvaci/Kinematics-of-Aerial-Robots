# Kinematics-of-Aerial-Robots
This work addresses the forward and inverse kinematics of payloads carried by aerial robots. Flight dynamics is the science of air vehicle orientation and control in three dimensions. The three critical flight dynamics parameters are the angles of rotation in three dimensions about the vehicle's center of mass, known as pitch, roll, and yaw.
